# PR 764 — portable Thing transfer

## Scope and current checkpoint — 2026-09-11

The requested outcome is broad export/import, actual browser/OS clipboard
Copy/Cut, and downloadable files/ZIPs that can be imported again. This PR is
still in progress; the Things clipboard/download checkpoint is not completion
of that scope.

- Versioned portable JSON carries content, kinds, extended data, folder and
  target relationships, but never account ownership or authorization envelopes.
- ZIP archives contain a manifest plus numbered, size- and SHA-256-checked
  file entries. Traversal paths, missing/unexpected entries and inflated size
  violations fail before any import. Collection drains folder pagination and
  deduplicates bounded dependency graphs.
- `api.things-export` 1.0.0 performs fresh authorized reads, canonicalizes app
  aliases, preserves gallery placement and returns a bounded plan. File bytes
  are separately reauthorized, size-checked and hashed before delivery.
- `api.things-import` 1.0.0 creates new private caller-owned Things through
  ordinary schema, permission and quota checks. IDs and executable references
  are remapped server-side; partial failures clean only newly created records.
  Managed account/control kinds require their dedicated workflows.
- Things now has an Import dialog with JSON/ZIP validation, destination choice,
  explicit file-upload and private-copy confirmation, normal upload retries,
  and account-keyed teardown. Import POSTs are never automatically retried.
  A lost response requires checking Things before another attempt.
- Things Copy/Cut write portable content to the OS clipboard. Paste imports
  private copies unless matching in-memory cut intent belongs to the same
  account/session; clipboard text can never request a destructive move.
  Download offers ZIP/JSON and folder/dependency/file inclusion choices.

## Evidence

- 85 Things tests and 38 API capability tests passed, covering content, ZIP bytes,
  malformed/oversized envelopes, authorization, rollback and cancellation.
- Real local API integration imported six disposable folder/schema/data/action/
  component/page Things, exported and re-imported them, verified private
  ownership and remapped references, ran both copied actions, denied anonymous
  export, then deleted all twelve copies.
- An isolated Chrome session using a disposable local fixture account checked
  invalid input, JSON file selection, desktop/mobile dialog bounds, a real
  two-Thing import and the refreshed folder listing. Real clipboard Copy/Paste,
  downloaded JSON and ZIP file-picker re-imports, and same-session Cut/Paste
  moving the original folder all passed. Eight disposable Things were cleaned
  after the complete browser run. Desktop/mobile export screenshots and bounds
  were inspected; existing mobile global-nav crowding remains outside these dialogs.
- Full Vite/embed/Nitro build and Vercel-output verification passed. The built
  well-known capability response advertises export/import 1.0.0. A separate
  attempted `/api/v1/capabilities` probe was not a valid manifest endpoint;
  it is not counted as a passing smoke.
- Targeted new-file lint passed. ThingsPage retains five existing hook warnings.
  Full typecheck still has unrelated baseline errors; the focused output has
  no errors in changed transfer/import/upload files after corrections.

## Remaining acceptance

Complete all file/gallery forms: linked galleries currently fail explicitly
rather than silently disappearing, and split-template imported media still
needs its dedicated rebinding adapter. Wire OS clipboard Copy/Cut/Paste and
Download across Builder/components and generic menus. Verify stored file bytes through
the real import UI, account transitions, partial failures and desktop/mobile
dynamic states. Verify current-head CI and preview independently of local tests.
