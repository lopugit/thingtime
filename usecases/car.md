# Car Use Case

Let's say you're the current owner of a car and you've been keeping track of all the repairs and maintenance that you've done to the car using Thing Time. You've logged every oil change, tire rotation, and any other repairs that you've done, along with the date and cost of each repair.

When it comes time to sell the car, you can export all the data from Thing Time into a report that shows all the repairs and maintenance that have been done on the car. This report can be shared with potential buyers, giving them a complete history of the car's maintenance.

By having this information readily available, potential buyers can see that the car has been well-maintained and can make a more informed decision about whether or not to buy the car. This can help increase the value of the car and make it easier to sell.

Additionally, as a buyer, you can use Thing Time to research the history of a car you're interested in purchasing. You can search for the car's VIN number and see if the previous owner has logged any repairs or maintenance on the car. This can help you determine if the car has been well-maintained and can help you make a more informed decision about whether or not to buy the car.
