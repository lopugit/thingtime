## [Unreleased]

### PR #13 - Remix Hydration, Vercel Status, And Deployment Hygiene

Detailed PR notes:
[PRs/13-codex-fix-hydration-mongodb-thingtime-defaults--codex-fix-hydration-and-footer-status-updates.md](PRs/13-codex-fix-hydration-mongodb-thingtime-defaults--codex-fix-hydration-and-footer-status-updates.md)

### Added

- Added shared Chakra/Emotion SSR style context so critical Emotion CSS is
  rendered as part of the Remix document tree. — _Codex (AI), 2026-06-22_
- Added a Vercel deployment footer status indicator with tokenless fallback and
  optional Vercel API-backed build phase/progress links. — _Codex (AI),
  2026-06-22_
- Added local development and deployment runbook notes for PM2-managed Remix
  restarts, Vercel duplicate-SHA deploy skipping, and PR-specific change notes.
  — _Codex (AI), 2026-06-22_

### Changed

- Improved footer health indicators so Vercel and MongoDB unavailable states
  render visible neutral grey status dots instead of appearing blank. —
  _Codex (AI), 2026-06-22_
- Made Vercel status resolution derive the project name from Vercel's repo slug
  when only `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` is configured, use this project's Vercel
  project/team fallback IDs and dashboard owner slug, and stop mixing tokenless
  phase text into API error labels. — _Codex (AI), 2026-06-22_
- Completed proper Chakra/Emotion document hydration wiring around
  `hydrateRoot(document, ...)`, server-collected Emotion style chunks, and a
  one-shot client Emotion sheet handoff before first paint. — _Codex (AI),
  2026-06-22_
- Removed the manual Emotion style clone/restore loop and made Vercel Analytics
  client-only after mount to avoid initial hydration/document mismatches. —
  _Codex (AI), 2026-06-22_
- Replaced invalid Remix loader typing and tightened root loader env/branch data
  so preview footers prefer Vercel's current git branch metadata. —
  _Codex (AI), 2026-06-22_

### Fixed

| # | Problem | Fix | Author | Date |
|---|---------|-----|--------|------|
| 1 | Emotion hydration caused `insertBefore` crashes, flash-of-unstyled content, boxed icons, and update-depth risk. | Hydrate the Remix document with server-rendered Emotion style tags in the React tree and perform the Emotion handoff pre-paint. | Codex (AI) | 2026-06-22 |
| 2 | Vercel serverless wrapped Emotion CJS modules differently than local default imports expected. | Resolve `@emotion/cache` and `@emotion/server/create-instance` across direct, default, named, and nested default export shapes. | Codex (AI) | 2026-06-22 |
| 3 | Vercel previews could show `git/unknown`, and repeated branch-head deployments could rebuild unchanged SHAs. | Prefer Vercel git env vars for branch display and document/test an Ignored Build Step duplicate-SHA guard. | Codex (AI) | 2026-06-22 |
| 4 | Local dev-server and PR validation workflow details were scattered across chat. | Document PM2-managed Remix restarts, PR-specific notes, and verification in project docs. | Codex (AI) | 2026-06-22 |
| 5 | `smarts.merge(..., { clone: true })` behavior was at risk during PR cleanup. | Verified the clone path still deep-clones nested values without mutating the source object. | Codex (AI) | 2026-06-22 |

### Verified

- Targeted Remix ESLint checks, production build, compiled SSR bundle import,
  local browser smoke checks, Vercel status endpoint checks, duplicate-SHA
  ignored-build testing, and `graphify update .` all ran during PR validation.
