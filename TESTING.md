# TESTING.md — per-area manual test checklists

Run the checklist for every area a PR touches, in a live browser against the
local dev stack (`npm run web-pms`, worktree stacks get their own port trio —
see `AGENTS.md`). Each list is the distilled regression history of that area:
every line exists because it broke once. Add a line whenever a new bug class
is fixed, and cite the checklist you ran in the PR description.

## Composer — Thingtime tab (`remix/app/components/Feed/PostComposer.tsx`)

- [ ] Open the feed composer → Thingtime tab: the editor shows exactly ONE
      root property, `New Thing`, with no default children (no `name`).
- [ ] The draft path is session-scoped (`tmp.<sessionId>.New Thing`): add a
      field, reload the page, reopen the tab → the draft is EMPTY again and
      the store's `tmp` branch holds only the new session.
- [ ] Post button stays disabled until the thing has real content (empty
      strings don't count; numbers/booleans/nulls do).
- [ ] Photos toggle ON requires ≥1 valid image URL before Post enables;
      Marketplace toggle ON requires valid listing fields. Toggling either
      off re-enables Post on thing content alone.
- [ ] Posting a thing + photo + listing renders the card as thing → photo
      grid → listing, with the first photo appearing exactly once.
- [ ] Change type on the `New Thing` root (context menu → change type):
      string shows a text editor that accepts input; boolean shows a boolean
      editor; the seed effect must NOT clobber the converted value back to {}.
- [ ] Rename the `New Thing` root TWICE in a row (click the key, type, Enter;
      repeat) on a FRESH page load: both renames must land in the store, not
      just the visible text. Regression class: memoized JSX pinning a
      mount-time `updatePath` whose `parent` was undefined pre-seed, and
      string path bindings (editor leaf, composer draftPath) not following
      the first rename (`path-renamed` bus event).
- [ ] The in-post editor height-drags via the bottom handle (mouse and touch)
      with no upper limit, and never below the small floor.

## Editor windows & layer system (`remix/app/components/Thingtime/EditorSplit.tsx`)

- [ ] Every toolbar control on a FLOATING frame (splits, edit toggle, reader/
      code toggle, pop-out, dock-in, ▲▼ layer arrows, …) fires its action on
      click — none of them start a frame drag. Dragging empty toolbar space
      still moves the frame.
- [ ] The composer's pop-out button duplicates the window into a native
      floating frame (traffic lights + toolbar); the in-post editor stays and
      both live-sync through the store.
- [ ] New frames layer ABOVE the drawer; hovering the drawer brings it to
      front, mouse-leave hands it back.
- [ ] ▼ on the top below-drawer frame / ▲ on the bottom above-drawer frame
      crosses the drawer WITHOUT changing relative window order; ⇧-click is
      bring-to-front / send-to-back.
- [ ] Close or dock a below-drawer frame: the frames stacked above it must
      STAY above the drawer (layer divider accounting).
- [ ] Open a dropdown (feed Filters, Algorithm menu) and a drawer modal with
      a frame floating: menus (10220) and modals (10240/10250) render ABOVE
      the frame; the chrome z ladder is documented in
      `remix/app/components/Nav/Drawer/useDrawer.tsx`.
- [ ] Dragging a window from one editor instance over ANOTHER instance's
      window must not dock (and must never lose the window) — drop targets
      are instance-scoped.
- [ ] `/editor` still opens with its two-window default and the drawer's
      Editor section still lists/saves/restores layouts (embedded composer
      editors must never appear there).

## Multi-editor focus (`remix/app/components/Editor/LongTextEditor.tsx`)

- [ ] With the popout open (same path in two editors), click into an
      editor.js field, type, wait ~1s (autosave echo remounts the OTHER
      instance), keep typing WITHOUT re-clicking: the caret must stay exactly
      where it was — no jump to block start, no focus loss. Test typing in
      the popout and in the in-post editor.
- [ ] Single-editor echo: typing continuously through several autosaves in
      one editor never remounts or resets it (signature echo acknowledgment).

## Feed thing rendering (`remix/app/components/Thingtime/ThingView.tsx`)

- [ ] A thingtime post renders its thing as the NATIVE Thingtime tree in view
      mode — right-click opens the thing context menu, Toggle Edit Mode makes
      values editable (numbers get steppers, booleans a switch, Editor.js
      docs the block editor), and edits stay LOCAL: reloading the feed
      restores the server value, and neither the viewer's persisted
      thingtime blob nor the composer's tmp draft branch is touched.
- [ ] A thing that resolves a kind renderer (a `render:` prop naming a kind,
      an explicit kind, or a structural match — in that priority order)
      shows the RENDERED form by default, with a small corner 🌀 icon back
      to the Thingtime view and ✨ back again; things resolving no renderer
      show the tree with no corner icon.
- [ ] Editor.js docs render as rich text by default everywhere: a rich-text
      post body (feed + profile), a nested rich-text value inside a tree,
      and /search crystal chips (plain-text preview, never raw block JSON).
- [ ] Untrusted (other users') things are only auto-rendered for the
      vetted-safe kinds (rich-text, image, audio, playlist, podcast, article,
      quote, book, movie, link, file, code, repository); every other kind —
      including the arbitrary-markup `chakra`/`element` kinds — falls back to
      the sanitising native tree with no rendered toggle.
- [ ] SECURITY (feed + search): a thing shaped as `kind:'link'` with
      `url:'javascript:…'` renders a card that is NOT a clickable link (no
      anchor, no "Open link"); a `chakra`/`element` thing with
      `props:{position:'fixed',inset:0,zIndex:99999,…}` renders as a data
      tree, NOT a viewport overlay; image/audio/cover URLs with unsafe schemes
      fall back to the emoji placeholder. Verify via DOM: no `a[href^=
      "javascript:"]`, no fixed/absolute high-z overlay from post content.
- [ ] Editing a feed thing (context menu → Toggle Edit Mode) and pressing
      Cmd/Ctrl+Z does NOT undo the viewer's own persisted tree — the keydown
      is contained to the sandbox (native field undo still works).
- [ ] A very large thing (deeply nested, hundreds of nodes) mounts COLLAPSED
      and scrolls within a bounded box — it never mass-mounts nodes or
      wall-of-texts the feed.

## Thing context menu (`remix/app/components/Thingtime/ContextMenu/`)

- [ ] Open the hover (popover) menu from a row inside a SMALL editor box: the
      menu must overflow the box freely (portal) and stay anchored to its
      trigger through page scroll, window resize, and layout shifts (e.g.
      height-dragging the composer editor while open).
- [ ] The menu renders above floating frames and drawer modals (z 10260).
- [ ] Drag-move and corner-resize the menu; near the right viewport edge it
      clamps inside the viewport without jitter.
- [ ] The design-system anatomy stories (/docs/design-system →
      thing-context-menu) still lay out statically inside their canvases
      (`inline` mode).

## Embed SSO / "Login with Thingtime" (`remix/app/components/OAuth/AuthorizePage.tsx`, `remix/app/api/utils/apps/`)

- [ ] Origins are DEFAULT-OPEN (owner decision): `/authorize?client_id=<real
      ttapp>&origin=<https origin NOT on the app's origins list>` (e.g. a
      Vercel preview URL) shows the login → consent flow, never "This origin
      is not on the app's allowlist". `/api/v1/apps/public` returns ok for
      any valid origin; only unknown clientIds (404) and malformed origins
      (400 — e.g. http on a non-localhost host) refuse.
- [ ] Registering an app without `origins` works (`POST /api/v1/apps
      { name }` → `origins: []`); updating origins to `[]` works; a bad
      entry (`ftp://…`, non-localhost http) still 400s.
- [ ] Token binding is per-token, not per-list: a minted app token works on
      `/api/v1/oauth/userinfo` with `Origin:` = the origin that opened the
      popup, is 403-rejected ("Origin does not match this token") from any
      other Origin, and KEEPS working after the app's origins list is edited.
      Deleting the app still kills its tokens.
- [ ] The consent screen always displays the requesting origin host next to
      the app name (both logged-out and consent states) — with open origins
      this display is the user's phishing signal; it must never be dropped.

## Data crystals & nesting depth (`remix/app/schemas/registry.ts`)

- [ ] Post a thingtime post whose thing contains an Editor.js document (or
      any structure) nested well past 6 levels: it must save (depth rail is
      64, a stack-safety bound only, with node/array caps as the real
      guards).
- [ ] Oversized payloads still fail loudly: >10000 nodes, >1000 array items,
      or a key with `$`/dots must 400 with a precise message, never silently
      drop data.
- [ ] `["post","data"]` combinations still 400 (data crystals stand alone);
      a thingtime post's free-form payload lives ONLY under `crystal.thing`.

## Feed & profile advanced filters (`remix/app/components/Feed/AdvancedFilters.tsx`)

- [ ] Filters ▸ Advanced opens the panel between the controls row and the
      composer; applying keeps the last-known posts rendered while loading
      (no skeleton flash); a FAILED search clears to the honest empty state.
- [ ] A sort-only search (e.g. oldest, nothing else) applies; relevance with
      no text does NOT activate advanced mode.
- [ ] Shortcuts round-trip: tags, by-user (unknown user = empty result, not
      an error), min reactions/comments (bounded-window mode), text length.
- [ ] Profile panels are locked to the profile's user (no By-user field) and
      the header post count stays the profile total, not the filtered count.

## Search page (`remix/app/components/Search/SearchPage.tsx`)

- [ ] Visiting plain `/search` fires NO search request (check the network
      tab): last-cached results still paint instantly, and with no cache the
      empty state invites a search ("then hit Search"), never claims
      "Nothing matched".
- [ ] Deep links still auto-run their search: `/search?q=…` (Commander's
      "Search things for…") and `/search?schema=…` (from /schemas).
- [ ] Submit a search and navigate to another page BEFORE it resolves: you
      stay on that page — the resolving search must never replace-navigate
      back to `/search` (or eat the destination's history entry). This
      includes loader-bearing destinations (`/login`, `/welcome`, `/status`)
      where /search stays mounted while the departure is pending, and Back
      from `/search?q=…` to plain `/search` (must not be undone).
- [ ] With a cache-restored query (input pre-filled from a previous session,
      no search run yet), Commander's "Search things for…" with that same
      text still fires a fresh search — the ?q= echo guard compares against
      the last q the page itself synced, never live input state.
- [ ] A submit rejected by number-validation, or a failed request, keeps the
      invite empty state ("then hit Search") — only a RESOLVED search may
      claim "Nothing matched". A failed first page also must not poison
      Load more: it continues the previous result set's query, not the
      failed one's params.
- [ ] A dead `?schema=` deep link (unknown/invisible shareId) toasts, strips
      the param from the URL, and fires NO fallback search; while a live
      `?schema=` resolves, no empty-state copy shows at all.
