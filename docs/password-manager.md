# Password manager

`/passwords` is an account-private credential library. Each account can own many
independent entries for the same service. Entries use the protected
`password-manager-entry` Thing schema and the reusable Thing `mods.layout=fields`
editor, with ordered fields, masked secrets and extensible custom fields. The
ordinary Thing tree is unchanged; controlled field mods do not persist values
through global Thing state, local caches, editor history or request diagnostics.

## Storage and access

`api.passwords` 1.1.0 uses the home data plane. GET returns 50 metadata records
at a time. POST requires a full, live user session and `expectedOwnerId`:
`read`, `save`, `delete`, `export`, `catalog`, and the `file-*` lifecycle operations. Export pages decrypt at most
50 entries using one bounded query and one account-key load. Scoped tokens, service accounts,
temporary accounts and internal Action identities are not vault sessions.
`catalog` returns names, usernames, exact HTTPS domains and public passkey
identifiers for native selection; passwords, TOTP seeds and signing keys are
excluded. Responses are private/no-store. The native picker checks the same
account again before filling and requires device-owner verification.

Field contents are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a random account data key, using
owner, key ID, record ID and purpose as authenticated data. The key is wrapped
with the user's password (scrypt) after successful password sign-in, and with
each live session (HKDF). Existing or SSO-only sessions can establish the
recovery/session wrappers before a password wrapper exists. A separate
server recovery wrapper is deliberately retained for the requested background
access and account recovery. This is **server-assisted encryption**, not a
zero-knowledge vault. A deployment administrator with both the recovery key and
database access can decrypt it. Password reset atomically replaces the password
wrapper while preserving the data key and revoking old sessions.

The title and credential category are private plaintext metadata; all field
labels, field values and ordered field definitions are inside the encrypted
payload. Password entries use canonical accounted Thing transactions. Revision
checks prevent stale writes; stable write IDs make retries idempotent; minimal
value-free deletion tombstones prevent delayed resurrection. General Thing
read/write/search/export and Timeline do not expose these protected records.
Imported password history is retained and available through the entry editor. There is no offline decrypted vault cache.
Draft edits stay in component memory, are masked when the tab loses focus, and
clear on account change, navigation, page teardown or Hide values.

The standard web API refuses implicit production fallback. The installed
Electron shell has an explicit exception: its loopback UI uses its selected
HTTPS account endpoint, with main-frame, origin and account checks. No alternate
endpoint is tried when a password request fails.

## QR codes and transfer

Upload PNG/JPEG/WebP or choose a screen/tab using the browser capture picker.
Images are decoded locally and discarded; streams stop after the capture.
`otpauth://totp` imports generate SHA-1/256/512 codes with 6 or 8 digits. The
screen-capture permission/picker is controlled by the browser/OS. On devices
without screen capture, upload a screenshot instead.

A `FIDO:` passkey QR is a live cross-device ceremony, not a transferable signing
key. Importing its image does not register a passkey. Choose Thingtime in the
native system provider picker when the service requests a new passkey. A
passkey reference can also record the location of a key held elsewhere.

Import/export supports 1Password 1PUX v3 and CSV, Chrome CSV and Apple Passwords
CSV. Imports preview every entry using ranged ZIP reads and a streaming JSON/CSV
parser. There are no product caps on archive bytes, expanded bytes, entry counts,
field counts, labels, or value lengths. The first 50 preview titles are a display
window. Saving uses stable write IDs and resumes after the last acknowledged item.
The database still imposes its actual 16 MiB BSON document ceiling on individual
encrypted entry documents; ciphertext overhead counts toward that capacity.
Deployment transport ceilings and available browser memory also remain real
platform constraints, not configurable product caps.

The coverage target is every datum in a 1PUX v3 file: all known and unknown item
categories, structured field values, sections and field attributes, tags,
favourites, archived state, IDs, timestamps, URLs, linked-item references, account
and vault attributes, password history, documents, attachments, icons, and unknown
properties. Standard fields are editable through Thing mods. The original item
and its account/vault attributes remain encrypted for inspection. A separate
archive entry owns every original ZIP member, including exact export.data and
export.attributes bytes, so unknown structures and original numeric literals
are recoverable even when the editor has no specialised widget for them.
Related source files are shown from imported entries. This is data preservation
and editing, not a claim to implement every 1Password application feature.

Files use the canonical multipart attachment lifecycle and storage accounting.
Each is a relational attachment Thing with purpose=password and targetId pointing
to its saved password entry. Browser AES-256-GCM encryption uses 1 MiB frames,
unique per-file keys/nonces, and authenticated file identity, plaintext size and
frame number. File names and keys are sealed with the account vault key. Only the
full-session password API can authorise file operations; ordinary attachment
content/export/copy/mutation routes cannot access them. Ciphertext is excluded
from external content moderation. Parent deletion tombstones the entry before
retryable exact-version object cleanup. S3's platform limits still apply.

1PUX backups stream JSON and file members into one ZIP. Original source members
and relationships are carried in the Thingtime vendor extension and restore with
new owner-local IDs. Other readers can use the standard item fields; unfamiliar
extension data may require Thingtime to restore. CSV has no attachment/custom
field representation; Chrome CSV also omits TOTP. Large CSV exports use numbered
files inside a ZIP. Desktop 1Password exports omit usable passkeys; those require
its mobile Credential Exchange flow. Thingtime's native passkey fields survive
its own backups, but other managers may treat them as ordinary custom data.
All export files contain unencrypted secrets; the UI requires acknowledgement.

## Native Password AutoFill

`apple/Passwords` contains the shared Swift library. `apple/PasswordProvider`
contains the AuthenticationServices extension used by iOS and the macOS
Thingtime Passwords companion embedded in Electron. The containing app needs
Apple's AutoFill entitlement and the same Keychain group as its extension.
Only the selected first-party HttpOnly session cookie is stored in the device's
unlocked-only, non-synchronizing data-protection Keychain. Every session operation
requires the configured shared access group; the macOS legacy Keychain is never
used. No vault passwords or signing keys are persistently cached on the device.
Logout/account or endpoint changes clear
the link; expired/revoked sessions fail at the server.

Open Passwords in the native app, choose **Connect Password AutoFill**, then
enable **Thingtime** in OS Settings → General → AutoFill & Passwords. System
configuration and biometric/device passcode prompts require the user. Password
and passkey providers require iOS 17/macOS 14; native OTP AutoFill requires
iOS 18/macOS 15. The provider uses exact HTTPS host matches for passwords/TOTP
and the OS-supplied relying party and allowed credential IDs for passkeys.
ES256 passkeys use random credential IDs, none attestation, a zero signature
counter for synchronized credentials and user verification. Encrypted storage
is acknowledged and read back before a new registration completes.

## Validation and setup

See the [README setup](../README.md#password-manager-setup) and
[manual QA checklist](../TESTING.md#password-manager-and-native-autofill).
`npm --prefix remix run test:passwords` covers crypto envelopes, session races,
formats, TOTP and HTTP boundaries. `node remix/scripts/verify-password-manager.mjs
http://localhost:<web-port>` exercises a disposable replica through HTTP only.
`swift test --package-path apple/Passwords` verifies real passkey signatures,
TOTP test vectors and session/domain validation. Builds alone do not establish
that signed OS registration or a third-party login ceremony works. iOS provider
ceremonies require a physical device; the simulator is a compile/UI check.
Record actual OS/device results separately in the delivery PR.

Screen-capture QA can use a synthetic canvas video stream in a disposable test page to exercise the real decoder and cleanup paths without sharing a desktop. This verifies video processing, cancellation, and stopped tracks, but does not substitute for OS picker/permission validation. Closing the editor aborts its pending scan; a stream returned by a late browser picker is immediately stopped.

For file lifecycle QA, register three disposable accounts through `/api/v1/register`
in an isolated localhost deployment, then configure the first username in
`ADMIN_USERNAMES` and restart that deployment. Supply a local JSON array of their
`{ "username": "qa-user", "password": "synthetic-only" }` credentials to
`pnpm --dir remix exec tsx scripts/verify-password-files.mts <localhost-origin> <fixture-path>`.
It uses real session/admin/password/upload endpoints and creates a synthetic
`/tmp/thingtime-password-import-qa/all-data.1pux` for browser round-trip checks.
Never point this test at production or supply personal credentials.
