# Tools

Let's say you have a power drill that you don't use very often, and you'd like to lend it to someone who needs it for a one-time project. You could create an entry for the power drill in your Thing Time account, including details such as its make and model, condition, and any special instructions or safety considerations. You could also specify the dates that the drill is available for lending.

Someone else who needs a power drill could search for one on Thing Time and find your entry. They could then request to borrow the drill for a specified period of time, and you would receive a notification of the request. If you approve the request, the borrower could pick up the drill from you or arrange for delivery.

After the borrower has finished using the drill, they could update the entry in Thing Time to indicate that it has been returned and any issues encountered during use. They could also pay you through Thing Time for the use of the tool, and you could set a rental fee for the drill.

Using Thing Time for tool sharing has several benefits. First, it helps to reduce waste and promote sustainability by allowing people to share resources instead of buying new ones. Second, it provides a convenient platform for finding and lending tools, which can be difficult to coordinate otherwise. Third, it provides a way to ensure that the borrower knows how to use the tool safely and correctly, reducing the risk of accidents or damage to the tool. Finally, the built-in payment system makes it easy to compensate the lender for the use of their tool, promoting fair exchange and contributing to a sharing economy.
