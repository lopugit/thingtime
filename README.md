# Thing Time

Thing Time is a powerful platform for storing and sharing information of all kinds. Whether you want to keep track of your personal notes, collaborate on a project with your team, or build a new app that relies on rich data, Thing Time has you covered.

With Thing Time, you can create and share any abstract data structure you want, or store any practical piece of information and share it for people and machines to use equally. Thing Time is not only a platform, but also an ecosystem that empowers developers and users alike to build, share, and utilize all kinds of data and knowledge.

Unlike traditional centralized data storage solutions, Thing Time is designed to be decentralized, flexible, and scalable. You can use Thing Time as a standalone app or integrate it with your existing software stack. Thing Time is also open source, so you can contribute to its development and customize it to your specific needs.

At Thing Time, we believe that data and knowledge should be open, accessible, and empowering. We are building Thing Time to make this vision a reality. Join us and start exploring the limitless possibilities of data!
